# Flight Fare Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict flight fares based on various factors such as departure date, airline, source, destination, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate flight prices, helping users make informed decisions when booking flights.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding relationships between features like airline, date, and price.
- **Model Training:** Training models Random Forest to predict flight fares.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.

## Results
The model predicts flight fares with reasonable accuracy, helping users find the best time to book flights. Model performance can be further improved by tuning hyperparameters and exploring more features.
